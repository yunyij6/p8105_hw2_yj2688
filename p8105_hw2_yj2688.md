    , professor = sum( ifelse( id == "professor", weight_tons, 0 ) ) 
    )

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3

``` r
balls = mr_trash_wheel %>%
  filter(!grepl("2020", year)) %>%
  summarise(balls = sum(ifelse( id == "mr", sports_balls, 0)))
```

There are 641 rows and 15 columns returned in the combined data set.
From data of Mr. Trash Wheel, the amount of trash collected decreased in
weight of 4.31 tons from May 2014 to 1.69 tons in July 2022. The change
in volume is not significant – trash collected in 2014 has a volume
around 15 per month, and in 2022 the volume is 13 cubic yards. This may
indicate that companies have employed light-weight packagings (trash
volume is the same but weight is decreased). The count of glass bottles
decreased from 72 in 2014 to 16 in July 2022, indicating that people are
recycling/reusing the glass bottles for storages etc. The number of
cigarette butts collected was up to 130000 in 2014, while the number
decrased to 4900 in 2022. This is because people are now using
e-cigarett or they quit smoking because of raising awareness of personal
health.

The above trend is different for Professor Trash Wheel, because its
weight of trash collected is always around 3 tons. But the volume of
trash per month is similar to Mr. trash wheel. The difference may be
caused by difference in area used, and difference in dimensions of the
trash wheel.

The total weight of trash collected by Mr. Trash Wheel is 1748.36 tons,
and the total weight of trash collected by professor trash wheel is
190.12 tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. trash
wheel in 2020 is 6021.

The “pol” table summarizes the number of national politicians
(democratic or republican) in a timeline (1947 - 2015). The “snp” table
summarizes the tandard & Poor’s stock market index from 1950 to 2015.
The “une” table describes the percentage of unemployment in each month
from 1948 to 2015. The joined table contains all of these data, with 823
rows and 11 columns, ranging from Janurary 1947 to July 2015. It allow
us to explore the relationship/trend of these political and economical
characteristics over time with the variables named as “president”
(political party of president), “close” (closing values of the S&P stock
index), and “result” (percentage of unemployment). We will be able to
produce a linear plot with 2 different lines representing trend of S&P
index and trend of unemployment, and markers with different colors that
distinguishes political party of president using the joined table.
